      <p>By,</p>
      <p>I know I haven't been the best boyfriend, and I'm truly sorry for this and sa tanan butang nga akong nabuhat that have caused you hurt. You mean the world to me, and I want you to know how much I care about you. </p>
      <p>You are the best thing that happened to me. And for me to allow myself to lose you is a very stupid thing to do. Maong I will not stop fighting for us.</p>
      <p>I promise to work on things, not only to save our relationship but to really become a better person. I know balik2 najud pero just really forgive me for stumbling. I am no expert sa life pd. This is my first time living life pd. I am still learning things along the way. But I want to learn things to be better and to always be there for you. You are my everything.</p>
      <p>And I know you're hurt. It is valid and I see you and hear you. Just know nga these mistakes will be a gateway to better. Just let us work this out. Please. You are everything that I have and I want.</p>
      <p>Just please stay. It gets better. And I know dumb and stubborn kyko for making these mistakes. It should have been avoided in the first place.</p>
      <p>Now I know, being in a relationship means not just about not having other relationships sa uban, or mag-igat2. Being in a relationship means not just avoiding cheating but also avoiding hurting your partner.</p>
      <p>And me, Bojee, knows that now. Dili lang enough ang di mag cheat. But being fully honest to everything. Even if it means disappointing you.</p>
      <p>And I know you're angry and still don't want to talk to me. But I'll be here. I am starting to figure things out na By. And you are a big part of it why naka hinay2 nakog tukod sako kaugalingon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My academic performance kay stable and doing good na</li>
        <li>I have doubled my effort in finding a job to sustain myself, you, and our relationship, and our future baby</li>
        <li>I have an improved relationship with my family kay tungod gi encourage ko nimo nga to open up more to them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are just the few things nga imo impact sako life and di masukod ang value</p>
      <p>And you are the only person that I want to experience the best version of Bojee</p>
      <p>You are my peace, my purpose, and my home‚ÄîI love you more than these words (or website) could ever show.</p>
      <p>With all my love,</p>
      <p>And from your kalagot nga uyab,</p>
      <p>Bojee</p>
